    "Now, let's try to be more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to perform a certain operation on many different inputs that will produce distinct outputs. What do we do? We write a _**function**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code which works a lot like a machine: it takes an input, does something to it, and produces an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input is put between brackets and can also be called the _argument_ or _parameter_. Functions can have multiple arguments.\n",

    "\n",
    "Functions are very useful in programming because they help you write shorter and more modular code. A good example to think of is the _print_ function, which we've used quite a lot in this module. It takes many different inputs and performs the specified task, printing its input, in a simple manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's write our own function. Let's look at the following rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining\n",
    "- All functions must start with the \"def\" keyword.  \n",
    "- All functions must have a name, followed by parentheses, followed by a colon. Eg. def hello( ):\n",
    "- The brackets may have a variable that stores its arguments (inputs)\n",
    "- All functions must have a \"return\" statement which will return the output. Think of a function like a machine. When you put something inside, you want it to return something. Hence, this is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling\n",
    "After you define a function, it's time to use it. This is known as _calling_ a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function, simply write the name of the function with your input variable in brackets (argument).\n"
