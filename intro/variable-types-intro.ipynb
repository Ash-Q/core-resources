    "### Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll talk about a few types of variables that you'll be using. As we saw in the example above, one common type of variable is the *integer* (positive and negative whole numbers). You'll also be using decimal numbers in Python, which are called *doubles* (positive and negative decimal numbers). \n",
    "\n",
    "A third type of variable used frequently in Python is the *string*; strings are essentially sequences of characters, and you can think of them as words or sentences. We denote strings by surrounding the desired value with quotes. For example, \"Data Science\" and \"2017\" are strings, while `bears` and `2020` (both without quotes) are not strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last variable type we'll go over is the *boolean*. They can take on one of two values: `True` or `False`. Booleans are often used to check conditions; for example, we might have a list of dogs, and we want to sort them into small dogs and large dogs. One way we could accomplish this is to say either `True` or `False` for each dog after seeing if the dog weighs more than 15 pounds. \n",
