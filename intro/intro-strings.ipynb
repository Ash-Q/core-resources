Well, to simplify, think of this: a class is a huge general category of something which holds particular attributes (variables) and actions (functions). Let's assume that Mars has aliens called Xelhas and one of them visits Earth. The Xelha species would be a class, and the alien itself would be an *instance* of that class (or an object). By observing its behavior and mannerisms, we would be able to see how the rest of its species goes about doing things.\n",
